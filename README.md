# Python Datetime Operations

## Description
This Python script demonstrates various datetime operations such as retrieving and formatting the current date and time, working with specific dates, calculating time differences, and handling time zones. It includes examples of parsing and formatting date and time using `strptime` and `strftime` methods.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the `pytz` library installed.

You can install the `pytz` library using pip:
```sh
pip install pytz
```

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:
```sh
python datetime_operations.py
```

## Code Explanation
This script performs the following tasks:

- Imports the necessary libraries (`datetime` and `pytz`).
- Retrieves and prints the current date and time.
- Prints various components of the current date and time such as year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
- Creates and prints a specific date (October 10, 2024).
- Calculates and prints the difference in days between two current times (expected to be 0).
- Parses and works with time using `strptime`.
- Calculates and prints the difference between two times in seconds and minutes.
- Works with time zones using `pytz` and prints the current time in the Karachi timezone.
- Formats date and time using `strftime`.
- Demonstrates the use of an alias for the `datetime` module.
- Custom formats date and time.
